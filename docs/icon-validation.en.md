# Icon fix 0.1.2

[中文](icon-validation.md)

## Problem

Embedding an ICO alone can leave native windows using a generic icon.

## Cause

Executable resources do not assign window icons. IDI_ICON1 is a string resource name. Qt windows need an explicit application icon resource.

## Changes

Embed the executable icon and include the ICO and resource script in the package.

## Measured

Final build and window checks will be recorded before local packaging.

## Not tested

This local icon fix does not constitute full hardware or desktop interaction acceptance.
